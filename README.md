## üöÄ Quick Setup for Events

1. **Deploy the web app** to your hosting platform
2. **Upload your custom PNG marker** to `/assets/markers/`
3. **Upload your event MP4 video** to `/assets/videos/`
4. **Generate QR code** linking to your deployed URL
5. **Share QR code** with event attendees

## üìã Event Requirements

### Essential Files Needed:
- **Custom PNG Marker Image** (recommended: high contrast, unique pattern)
- **Event MP4 Video** (optimized for mobile: 1080p max, H.264 codec)
- **Hosting Platform** (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or custom server)

### Technical Requirements:
- HTTPS hosting (required for camera access)
- Mobile-optimized server with video streaming support
- Fast CDN for optimal video loading

## üîß Development & Testing

### Local Development:
```bash
# Install a local HTTPS server (required for camera access)
npm install -g http-server
# or
npm install -g live-server

# Serve with HTTPS (required for mobile camera)
http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem -p 8080
# or use ngrok for HTTPS tunnel
ngrok http 8080
```

### Mobile Testing:
1. **Test on actual devices** - Camera behavior varies between browsers
2. **Verify auto-play policies** - Some browsers require user interaction
3. **Check marker detection range** - Test in various lighting conditions
4. **Validate video loading** - Ensure smooth playback on mobile networks

## üìê Marker Design Guidelines

For optimal detection on mobile devices:
- **Size**: Minimum 200x200px, recommended 500x500px
- **Contrast**: High contrast black/white elements
- **Complexity**: Detailed enough to be unique, simple enough for mobile cameras
- **Border**: Include clear white border around the marker
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background support

## üé¨ Video Optimization

Recommended MP4 settings for mobile:
- **Resolution**: 720p-1080p maximum
- **Codec**: H.264 (baseline profile for compatibility)
- **Bitrate**: 1-3 Mbps for mobile networks
- **Duration**: Keep under 30 seconds for optimal loading
- **Audio**: AAC codec, consider muted auto-play compliance

## üåê Deployment Options

### Recommended Platforms:
- **Netlify**: Easy deployment with HTTPS
- **Vercel**: Optimized for mobile performance
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with custom domains
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Scalable for large events

### Performance Considerations:
- Enable gzip compression for faster loading
- Use CDN for video assets
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Optimize images and compress videos

## üîí Privacy & Permissions

- Camera access required (users will see browser permission prompt)
- No video recording - only real-time marker detection
- No personal data stored or transmitted
- Event attendee privacy compliant

## üìû Event Support

### For Event Organizers:
- Test the experience before your event
- Provide clear instructions to attendees
- Have backup QR codes ready
- Consider lighting conditions at venue

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure attendees allow camera permissions
- Verify HTTPS connection for camera access
- Test marker visibility in event lighting
- Have technical support contact available
